# Introduction
In digitisation the best way to supplement a digital record of a specimen is to have an accompanying image which shows the specimen. The imaging of specimens is typically performed using either a camera or a flat-bed scanner, although 3D scanning of specimens has also applied, e.g. [Plum and Labonte 2021](https://peerj.com/articles/11155/) despite the added time and financial costs.

We have put together a few introductory pages covering several aspects of specimen photography that aims to clarify the objectives, technical specifications, and jargon of imaging museum specimens. This should be a guide to making sense of photography in your own digitisation efforts and allow you to understand the advice given in the specimen workflows.
